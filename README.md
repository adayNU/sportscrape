# sportscrape

The purpose of this reposititory is to make it simple to look for upcoming Northwestern sporting events in the Bay Area so that the NU Club of SF can attend and cheer on the 'Cats! It scrapes each team's schedule page and then checks if the Location is less than 50 miles away from San Francisco.

Go 'Cats!
